<strong>Next Steps:</strong> We'd like to allow users to see a poems image on the index page before going to it's details page, download their poem once it's been made, save poems by others with likes, tag a poem with a genre, be able to see poems collected by the their genre tag, visit a page that generates random poem prompts, and a page that pulls a random published poem for inspiration.
